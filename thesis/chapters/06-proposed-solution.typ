= Proposed solution <proposedsolution>

// Investigation and design of a proposed solution for identification of optimal boundary identification

// REQUIREMENTS
// Functional: visualization, user-imposed priorities, gradual migration, technology
// Non-functional: usability, performance, maintainability, license

// COLLECTION
// Static analysis of code base (because no requirements or design documents)
// Dynamic analysis, because inherent polymorphism and late binding -> through execution and also integration tests
// Version history (because strong culture of code ownership), but only from specific commits (because Link v5 refactor)

// DECOMPOSITION

// ANALYSIS
// Application is not stateful (or negligible), so no database dependencies
