=== Conclusion

// TODO: summary/conclusion
// Answer to RQ2

Each monolithic application is unique, and has its own requirements, constraints, and challenges.
When migrating a monolithic application to a microservices architecture, there are many facets to take into consideration, such as the application's architecture, the organization's structure, the teams's capabilities, and the business requirements.
As such, proposing a general migration framework that fits all applications is not feasible, and every software architect has a different and unique approach to the process.

In this chapter, we attempted to comprehensively describe the state of the art on (semi-)automated technologies for modularization of monolithic applications.
