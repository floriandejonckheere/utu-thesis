// Enumeration of existing automated technologies for modularization of monolith codebases
// Answer to Research Question 2.

In this chapter, we will investigate the state of the art in automated technologies for modularization of monolith codebases.
We will answer the following research question:

*Research Question 2*: What are the existing approaches and tools for automated modularization of monolith codebases?

Using a systematic literature review, we will identify and categorize existing literature regarding automated modularization of monolith codebases.
We will also provide a brief overview of the most relevant approaches and tools.

A systematic literature review is used to identify, evaluate and interpret research literature for a given topic area, or research question @systematic_literature_review_guidelines.
The systematic nature of systematic literature reviews reduce bias through a well-defined sequence of steps to identify and classify existing literature.
Studies directly researching the topic area are called _primary_ studies, systematic studies aggregating and summarizing primary studies are called _secondary_ studies.

The literature review is conducted using a three-step protocol as defined by #cite(<systematic_literature_review_guidelines>, form: "author") @systematic_literature_review_guidelines:
