// General introduction to the topic

== Scope and goal

// Scope of the research thesis

This research is centered around three research questions:

*Research Question 1*: Which challenges and opportunities arise when considering adoption of the modular monolith architecture in an existing codebase?

*Research Question 2*: Which automated technologies exist to aid modularization of monolithic codebases?

*Research Question 3*: How can _(automated technology)_ effectively identify optimal module boundaries in a modular monolith architecture?

To answer the first research question, we will first define the modular monolith architecture, and examine what sets it apart from monolithic and microservices architectures.
Then, we will proceed to investigate the merits and drawbacks of the software architecture when applied to an existing codebase.

For the second research question, we will enumerate the existing technologies to aid modularization of monolithic codebases, and choose one automated technology for further examination.
_(Automated technology)_ will then be implemented for a given use case, and compared to manual modularization efforts in terms of accuracy, efficiency, development velocity.
This comparison will help us to answer the third research question.

The goal of this research can be summarized as follows:

+ Investigate the merits and drawbacks of the modular monolith architecture in an existing codebase
+ Investigate the use of automated technologies to modularize a monolithic architecture

The proposed solution will add value to the field of software engineering, and will be able to be used as a base for future improvements regarding automated modularization of monolith codebases.

== Motivation

// Explanation about why and for whom the topic is relevant, and what the expected outcome of the thesis is

== Methodology

// Explanation of the research methodology used

== Outline

// General outline of the sections
The thesis is divided into three parts.

The first part comprises the background and related work.
In @introduction, the scope and goal of the research is defined, and the research questions are formulated.
The stakeholders are identified, and the methodology is explained.
@background introduces the reader to the research background and necessary concepts.
In @relatedwork, the existing literature is reviewed, and the state of the art is presented.

The second part of the thesis, starting with @modularmonolith, is dedicated to the first research question.
The modular monolith architecture is defined, and its merits and drawbacks are discussed.

The third part aims to solve the second and third research question.
@modularization gives an introduction into the automated modularization of monolith codebases, listing the existing technologies.
It then continues to focus on one automated technology, _(automated technology)_, and explains its implementation.
@casestudy applies _(automated technology)_ on a given case study, and compares it to manual modularization efforts.

Finally, @conclusion summarizes the findings, and gives an outlook on future work.
