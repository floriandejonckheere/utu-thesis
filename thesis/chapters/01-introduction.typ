= Introduction

// General introduction to the topic

== Problem statement

// Identification of challenges and obstacles related to the topic

== Scope and goal

// Scope of the research thesis

This research is centered around two research questions:

*Research Question 1*: Which challenges and opportunities arise when considering adoption of the modular monolith architecture in an existing codebase?

*Research Question 2*: How can _(automated technology)_ effectively identify optimal module boundaries in a modular monolith architecture?

To answer the first research question, we first define the modular monolith architecture, and examine what sets it apart from monolithic and microservices architectures.
Then, we proceed to investigate the merits and drawbacks of the software architecture when applied to an existing codebase.

For the second research question, we enumerate the existing technologies to aid modularization of monolithic codebases, and choose one automated technology for further examination.
_(Automated technology)_ is then implemented for a given use case, and compared to manual modularization efforts in terms of accuracy, efficiency, development velocity.

The goal of this research can be summarized as follows:

+ Investigate the merits and drawbacks of the modular monolith architecture in an existing codebase
+ Investigate the use of automated technologies to modularize a monolithic architecture
