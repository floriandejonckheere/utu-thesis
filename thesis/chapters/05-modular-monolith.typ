= Modular monolith architecture <modularmonolith>

// Definition and explanation of modular monolith software architecture

== Background

// Definition and explanation of modular monolith architecture
// Justification for choice of modular monolith in this thesis

== Challenges and opportunities

// Answer to Research Question 1

// TODO: discuss testing strategies, security concerns, external dependencies, transactional context, Conway's law

== Modularization

// https://www.kamilgrzybek.com/blog/posts/modular-monolith-primer

// Problem statement regarding identification of optimal module boundaries

// Microservice is architectural style or just SOA-approach? @carrasco_etal_2018

// Explain the process of modularization, including the identification of modules
// TODO: explain graphs in mathematical terms
// TODO: explain difference between top-down approach and bottom-up approach

// TODO: discuss difference between modularization to microservices and modular monolith
// TODO: read Migrating to a microservice architecture: benefits and challenges
