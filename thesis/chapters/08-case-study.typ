= Case study <casestudy>

// Application of the proposed solution to a real-world use case
// Answer to Research Question 3

== Background

// Background information about the use case
// Application is not stateful (or negligible), so no database dependencies

== Experimental setup

// Description of the experimental setup

// Information extraction
// - Version history (because strong culture of code ownership), but only from specific commits, because Link v5 refactor (@lourenco_silva_2023)
//      Justify why this strategy is applicable, and mention the parameters (how many commits, authors, timespan, etc.)

== Evaluation and results

// Evaluation and results of the proposed solution in the context of the use case

== Discussion

// Analysis and discussion of the results
// Justify the reason for existence of the modular monolith paradigm

== Threats to validity

// Ability of the proposal solution to generalize
