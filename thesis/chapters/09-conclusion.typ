// Summary of the thesis

// SLR conclusion

//In this chapter, we attempted to provide a comprehensive overview of the state of the art on (semi-)automated technologies for modularization of monolithic applications.
//We have identified and described the most frequently used methods and approaches, and compared them against each other.
//We have enumerated and described the most frequently used algorithms and quality metrics, and discussed their advantages and disadvantages. /* TODO: discuss advantages and disadvantages */
//
//Using the results of our systematic literature review, we were able to answer the research questions that motivated this review:
//
//*Research Question 2*: What are the existing approaches and tools for automated microservice candidate identification in monolith codebases?
//
//Each monolithic application is unique, and has its own requirements, constraints, and challenges.
//When migrating a monolithic application to a microservices architecture, there are many facets to take into consideration, such as the application's architecture, the organization's structure, the teams's capabilities, and the business requirements.
//As such, proposing a general migration framework that fits all applications is not feasible, and every software architect has a different and unique approach to the process.
