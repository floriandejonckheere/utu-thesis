// Summary of the thesis

// SLR conclusion

//In this chapter, we attempted to provide a comprehensive overview of the state of the art on (semi-)automated technologies for modularization of monolith applications.
//We have identified and described the most frequently used methods and approaches, and compared them against each other.
//We have enumerated and described the most frequently used algorithms and quality metrics, and discussed their merits and demerits. /* TODO: discuss merits and demerits */
//
//Using the results of our systematic literature review, we were able to answer the research questions that motivated this review:
//
//*Research Question 2*: What are the existing approaches and tools for automated microservice candidate identification in monolith codebases?
//
//Each monolith application is unique, and has its own requirements, constraints, and challenges.
//When migrating a monolith application to a microservices architecture, there are many facets to take into consideration, such as the architecture of the application, the structure of the organization, the capabilities of the team, and the business requirements.
//As such, proposing a general migration framework that fits all applications is not feasible, and every software architect has a different and unique approach to the process.



== Future work

// Possible future work related to the topic

// Literature Review: lot of papers in recent years, so presumably we will see a pickup in this topic

// Proposed solution:
// Use more information (e.g. dynamic analysis, semantic coupling)
// Static analysis can only detect limited references, dynamic analysis can detect more

// Proposed solution:
// Performance: current tools are slow, need to be faster
// Rewrite in Rust (https://github.com/lib-ruby-parser/lib-ruby-parser)
